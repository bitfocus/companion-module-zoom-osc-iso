## Zoom ZoomOSC

## ZoomOSC/ISO module

This module is rebuild for the new version (> 4.0.5) of Zoom OSC/ISO.

It is based on the principle of selecting a caller or caller group first and then do an user action

There is a group special presets, to set some basic's. when you feel the user database needs an update, use the request list users preset/action.

Drag your callers to a button and use that to put them into pre-selection. Feedback will so you which one is active.
