## ZoomOSC/ISO module

This module is rebuild for the new version (> 4.0.5) of Zoom OSC/ISO.

It is based on the principle of selecting a caller or caller group first and then do an user action. You can find the callers in the presets (Select Callers).
There is also an option: Select from Gallery. Based on the callers that are in drag the position to your streamdeck, so quick selection based on position is possible.
You'll find feedback standard on the buttons (mic live, selected)

When you have selected some callers, you can put them in a group. After that you can select the group and preform an action.

There is a group "special presets", to set some basic's. when you feel the user database needs an update, use the request list users preset/action. Al other regular actions can be found within the preset categories.

You can even rename the users and groups, internally
> Rename can be handy to make it more readable, but it won't change the name in Zoom.
