## ZoomOSC/ISO module

This module is rebuild for the new version (> 4.0.5) of Zoom OSC/ISO.

It is based on the principle of selecting a caller or caller group first and then do an user action

There is a group "special presets", to set some basic's. when you feel the user database needs an update, use the request list users preset/action.

Drag your callers to a button and use that to put them into pre-selection. Feedback will so you which one is active.
This will work for groups too. Default is 5 groups

You can even rename the users and groups, internally
> Rename can be handy to make it more readable, but it won't change the name in Zoom.
